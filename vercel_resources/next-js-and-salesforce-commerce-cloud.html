Once the norm, legacy platforms now create headaches for tech leaders and developers. From low SEO performance to hindering creativity, full stack solutions can't give your customer the experience your business wants. Pages load slower, engineering teams are bloated and overwhelmed, and developers lack flexibility.

Your business has grown to a point where you need to augment your existing Salesforce Commerce Cloud stack. It used to be standard to have every aspect your stack managed in one place, and building a custom frontend was nearly impossible. Ecommerce systems have evolved.

Today, the narrative has shifted. You can decouple your front and backend, mixing and matching the best of every technology to get the exact user experience you want. With Next.js and Vercel, it's easy–and you'll be setting up your team for future success and savings.

#### 55% greater success
