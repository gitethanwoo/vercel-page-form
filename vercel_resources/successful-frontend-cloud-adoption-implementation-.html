---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A frontend cloud is a suite of cloud-native tools—like global infrastructure and caching, observability, and workflow tooling—designed to help companies and developers deliver the best web experience for their users.

This toolkit addresses the unique requirements of frontend developers, providing a comprehensive suite of tools and services designed to facilitate the development, testing, and deployment of high-quality web applications. It offers a wide range of benefits for organizations seeking to optimize their web development processes, improve time to market, and deliver engaging user experiences.

From Netflix to Traeger Grills, these unique advantages are spurring high-performing enterprise engineering teams to adopt a frontend cloud.

This whitepaper will outline the process an organization may follow for frontend cloud adoption, followed by potential roadblocks and suggested ROI measurements.

### [4. Develop a migration plan](https://vercel.com/resources/successful-frontend-cloud-adoption-implementation-roi#4.-develop-a-migration-plan)

Outline the necessary steps for migrating your existing frontend assets and infrastructure to the chosen frontend cloud platform.

### [5. Train your team](https://vercel.com/resources/successful-frontend-cloud-adoption-implementation-roi#5.-train-your-team)

Ensure that developers and other stakeholders are well-versed in the new tools, technologies, and workflows associated with the frontend cloud.

Choose a frontend cloud solution that has a robust offering of:

*   **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and tutorials to help developers get started with the platform, covering topics such as deployment, performance optimization, and security.
*   **Training and support**: Online training and support resources, including forums, Slack communities, and customer support, to help developers and stakeholders learn and troubleshoot any issues they encounter.
*   **Integrations**: Integrates with other developer tools and services, such as CMS or commerce tool of choice, your Git provider of choice, and any observability or monitoring tools to streamline workflows and reduce the learning curve associated with adopting a new platform.
*   **Community resources:** A strong and active community of developers who contribute to open-source projects, share best practices, and provide peer support through online forums and social media.
*   **Enterprise support:** For enterprise customers, additional services such as dedicated support, training, and customized onboarding to ensure a smooth transition to the new tools and workflows. 

### [6. Monitor progress and iterate](https://vercel.com/resources/successful-frontend-cloud-adoption-implementation-roi#-6.-monitor-progress-and-iterate)

Continuously assess the effectiveness of your frontend cloud adoption, making adjustments as needed to optimize outcomes and achieve your desired goals.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a smooth tech stack transition, it’s important to address potential challenges proactively. Here are some anticipated roadblocks that your team may address in advance of your frontend cloud journey:

### [Addressing concerns about vendor lock-in](https://vercel.com/resources/successful-frontend-cloud-adoption-implementation-roi#-addressing-concerns-about-vendor-lock-in)

Choose a frontend cloud provider with a strong commitment to open standards and interoperability, minimizing the risk of being locked into a single platform.

### [Managing change resistance](https://vercel.com/resources/successful-frontend-cloud-adoption-implementation-roi#managing-change-resistance)

Communicate the benefits of adopting a frontend cloud to your team and involve them in the decision-making process to foster buy-in and minimize resistance to change. Gather stakeholders early, and start with an incremental migration (a subset of pages, or a single team) to prove out your solution.

### [Ensuring security and compliance](https://vercel.com/resources/successful-frontend-cloud-adoption-implementation-roi#ensuring-security-and-compliance)

Leverage the built-in security features of your frontend cloud provider and stay up-to-date on industry best practices to maintain a secure and compliant frontend environment.

### [Scaling your frontend cloud adoption](https://vercel.com/resources/successful-frontend-cloud-adoption-implementation-roi#scaling-your-frontend-cloud-adoption)
