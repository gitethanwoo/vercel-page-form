Enhance ecommerce using Next.js and Shopify. Learn how moving to headless results in fast, flexible sites and more conversions for your ecommerce store.

[Ecommerce systems have evolved](https://vercel.com/resources/fast-sites-with-next-js-and-shopify#ecommerce-systems-have-evolved-)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the norm, legacy platforms now create headaches for tech leaders and developers. From low SEO performance to hindering creativity, full stack solutions cannot give your customer the experience your business wants. Pages load slower, engineering teams are bloated and overwhelmed, and developers lack flexibility.

Your business has grown to a point where you need to augment your existing Shopify stack.

It used to be standard to have every aspect of your stack managed in one place, and building a custom frontend was nearly impossible. Ecommerce systems have evolved.

Today,[the narrative has shifted](https://vercel.com/resources/why-innovators-are-going-headless). You can decouple your front and backend, mixing and matching the best of every technology to get the exact user experience you want. With Next.js and Vercel, it’s easy–and you’ll be setting up your team for future success and savings.

#### 55% greater success

> Companies using a headless tech stack experience 55% greater success with digital commerce, compared to 30% for non-headless

[Understanding headless](https://vercel.com/resources/fast-sites-with-next-js-and-shopify#understanding-headless)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are some key terms we’ll be using in this article:

**Decoupling**

The art of taking the frontend and separating it from the backend.

**Frontend**

The frontend of a software stack refers to the user interface, for example a website on a desktop browser or a mobile app.

**Backend**

The backend is the rest of the software stack, like customer data, content management, and business logic. This is the part of your stack that the user does not see.

[Parachute](https://vercel.com/customers/parachute)is a modern lifestyle brand that offers thoughtfully designed products using premium quality materials. They initially deployed the Parachute site to Shopify because of its quick templates and SEO benefits. But after seven and a half years of rapid growth, they realized they’d outgrown the out-of-the-box offering and needed a solution that gave them more customization and flexibility—without slowing down their site or sacrificing SEO.

Vercel enabled a number of significant improvements to Parachute’s workflow from automating highly dynamic aspects of its site to providing preview access for stakeholders across the business.

With the ability to seamlessly integrate all of its favorite tools, Parachute was able to have the best of both worlds and build its site just the way it wanted—including retaining Shopify’s headless commerce and pairing Contentful with Vercel’s Incremental Static Generation feature to keep the site fast and content fresh.

Speed with scale is possible. Parachute was able to not only migrate to Next.js and Vercel in a month, but it also improved page load times by 60%.
