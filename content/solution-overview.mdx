# AI-Powered Sales Form Solution Overview

## Executive Summary

I built an intelligent sales contact form for Vercel.com that uses AI to automatically research prospects and generate personalized responses. The solution combines external web research with internal knowledge base search to deliver accurate, contextual sales outreach at scale.

## The Problem
Modern B2B buyers expect immediate, personalized responses. Traditional forms route to sales teams who manually research each lead - a process that's slow and doesn't scale. Often, naive AI solutions hallucinate features or provide generic responses that don't reflect actual product capabilities.

## The Solution

## What Sets This Apart

### 1. Curated Knowledge Base from Vercel Resources
I curated a high quality knowledge base by scraping [Vercel official resources](https://vercel.com/resources) to ensure product grounding and language alignment. This lets the research agent reference specific Vercel content, case studies, and messaging rather than generating generic responses.

### 2. Agent-in-a-Workflow
Combines two paradigms for the most appropriate solution: an agentic step for unstructured, discovery-oriented research, and a fixed writing step for task specialization. 


### Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Research Phase
const research = await generateText({
  model: openai('o3'),
  tools: {
    searchVercel: searchVercel,        // Upstash Vector DB
    web_search: webSearchPreview(),    // External context
  },
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(20),
});

// Response Phase
const response = await generateText({
  model: openai('chatgpt-4o-latest'),
  prompt: `${researchContext}...craft personalized response`,
});
```
